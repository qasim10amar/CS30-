be inherited, but it can still implement its methods.

6d. The methods that are available are doThis(), doThat(), and doNow().

6e. The method doThis() in the Roo object overwrites the Bo objects doThis() method

6f. It sends the 1 to the parent class to create the objects properties

6g. The accessor methods in Bo are accessible by Roo as it extends to it which allows a Roo object to call the doThis() method.

6h. By using super the method in Roo can call the doThis() method.
